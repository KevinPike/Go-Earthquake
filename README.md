Go-Earthquake
=============

The Data Structures and Algorithm projects at Virginia Tech were some of the funnest projects I've done. 
Building web applications can be some repetitive and boring -- CRUD this and CRUD that. 

So, I decided to check out projects that were offered in CS 3114 at Virginia Tech. McQuain's earthquake project interests me,
so I'm giving it a whirl in go.
